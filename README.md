# Hijithan's Website

My portfolio website is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating the Three.js library for 3D graphics. It showcases my skills and projects through interactive and visually engaging elements, providing a modern and dynamic user experience.\
You can access the website [here](https://xlmt09.github.io/portfolio/).

## Roadmap
I want to add the other planets to this website in the future, but im still thinking about the additional content to provide when landing on these planets.

## Credits
All image textures under the `planets` directory were taken from [solarsystemscope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/).
