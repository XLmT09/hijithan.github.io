I practised Test-Driven Development (TDD), utilized Maven for project management, wrote JUnit tests, and adhered to Git standards such as tagging and branching. Overall, this project helped me develop and follow solid software engineering principles.</p>

As part of the project, I integrated various features such as an admin dashboard for managing users and orders, a chef interface for confirming and processing orders, and a waiter interface for handling customer requests and managing the status of orders. Built using Django, HTML, CSS, JS and a relational database, this application serves as a comprehensive tool to improve restaurant workflows and enhance customer experiences.</p>

            <p>This project was developed as part of a university assignment during first year, where I collaborated with four other students to design and build a robotic bunny using LEGO bricks, the LeJOS EV3 platform, and Java programming. The goal was to create a robot that mimics the behaviour of a real bunny, with the ability to move around, respond to environmental stimuli, and interact with its surroundings. The project utilized various sensors to ensure the robot could avoid obstacles, react to sounds, and navigate based on color recognition.</p>

      <div class="box2">
        <p>
          <b>Thank you for visiting my website!</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I created this site as a personal project, inspired by the portfolios I've seen from others. Plus, I had some extra time during the Christmas break and wanted to put it to good use.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Why the space theme, you ask? While brainstorming ideas, YouTube recommended a few space-related videos, and I thought that incorporating this would make my site visually appealing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As for the green and black colour scheme, I initially thought it was inspired by one of my favourite games from the past, Fallout 4. However, when I revisited the game, I realized it didn't use this palette. 
          I guess it was just my imagination <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-wink"></i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          To refine my design, I researched several websites and analyzed their stylistic choices. One that stood out to me was <a href="https://webflow.com/ai" target="_blank">Webflow's AI website</a>, which I discovered under <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/black/" target="_blank">Best Black Websites</a> on Awwwards.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Thanks again for visiting :)
